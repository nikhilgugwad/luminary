## **Introduction**

**Luminary** is a modern web application designed for a seamless and flexible experience for managing products, categories, and images. It is built using Next.js for the frontend and Sanity.io for content management, allowing for easy customization and management of dynamic content. It supports a wide range of features to manage and display products with rich media content and flexible categorization.

The application provides an easy-to-use admin interface (via Sanity Studio) for managing product listings and other content. It supports multi-image handling, category referencing, and other essential features for e-commerce and product display websites.

## **Core Features**

- **Product Management**: Users can create and manage products, including images, descriptions, prices, and categories.
- **Category Management**: Create and manage product categories that can be referenced in individual product entries.
- **Hero Images**: Set up two hero images that can be displayed on the homepage, offering visual appeal and marketing functionality.
- **Dynamic Content**: Real-time updates to the product catalog via Sanityâ€™s CMS.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for mobile and desktop use.
- **Stripe Integration**: Integration with Stripe for payment processing and pricing management.

## **Tech Stack Used**

- **Frontend**:
  - **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  - **Shadcn UI**: A component library for styled UI components.
  - **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that offers optional static typing for better developer experience.
- **Backend**:
  - **Sanity.io**: A headless CMS for managing content (product listings, categories, images), to manage content and products efficiently we can utilize.
  - **Stripe**: For payment processing, including product pricing integration.
- **Deployment**:

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilgugwad/luminary-ecommerce-app.git
   cd luminary
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use `npm` or `yarn` to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project with the following content:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **API Endpoints**

Here are the main API endpoints that your app interacts with:

### **Sanity API Endpoints**

Sanity is used to fetch and manage content. The following endpoints are used for retrieving products and categories:

- **GET `/api/products`**: Fetch all products.
- **GET `/api/categories`**: Fetch all product categories.

### **Stripe API Endpoints**

- **POST `/api/checkout`**: Initiates the Stripe checkout process.

## **Deployment**

### **Vercel (Frontend Deployment)**

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Connect your GitHub repository and deploy the app to Vercel.
3. Set the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (same as `.env.local` above).
4. Once deployed, the app will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`.

### **Sanity (Content Management)**
